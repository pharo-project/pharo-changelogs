Lots of improvements related to  BlockClosures this week. 

First some helper methods on the AST:
- #hasNonLocalReturn: check if there is a non-local return
- #isConstant: Blocks of the kind [#justSomeLiteral]
- #constantValue: return that literal (and nil for empty [] )
- #numArgs for RBBlockNode, as we have already for BlockClosure  "[:a | ] sourceNode numArgs"

Some improvements for isClean:
- unify between AST and BlockClosure
- more tests
- inlined blocks can be clean, important as it is recursive: [true ifTrue: []] should be clean
- cleanup code in CleanBlock, receiver is known to be nil

Compiler support for ConstantBlockClosure:
- We can specialize clean blocks of the kind [#justSomeLiteral] to execute faster
- add ConstantBlockClosure, add compiler support, active when compiling with clean blocks enabled

Compiler support for full block without outer context:
- we only need the outerContext for non-local returns. 
- add support to IRBuilder for full blocks without outer context
- implement compiler support (option #optionBlockClosureOptionalOuter, false for now)

Quick return for Blocks:
- Compile quickreturn for CompiledBlock, just like CompiledMethod (e.g. for [^1]).
- speeds up execution a little (but of course not creation)
