# This week (30/2024) on the Pharo Issue Tracker

The most important not obvious news of the week: We managed to get the CI in a good shape again!
Test are now green for all three platforms. 

This is one of these aspects of development that are easily overlooked: 
Just keeping the CI green and running is far more work in a real project than you would naively think. 

Summer break: the weekly mails (but not the improvements to Pharo!) will take a break.
In the week of 26/08 we post the weekly logs for weeks 31-34.
